        description:"This degree project addresses the growing concern for security through the development of a system for automatic detection of violent situations. Using webcams connected to the Internet, the focus is on the Internet of Things (IoT). Deep learning algorithms are implemented, specifically convolutional and recurrent neural networks, such as MobileNetV2 and LSTM. These models analyze images from surveillance cameras in real time, classifying events as violent or non-violent with an average accuracy of 81.6%. The IoT infrastructure incorporates cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi 4, which processes the images and transfers the results to a MySQL database and the Grafana visualization platform. This system allows real-time monitoring and automatic generation of alerts through Telegram, thus contributing to public and private security in urban environments.",

        description:"This project centers around the creation of a user-friendly and efficient graphical user interface for handling batch and Python processes within the Windows environment. The application is designed to provide a clear overview of process status (whether running or not) and offers functionality to initiate processes with options for visible or background execution. Additionally, the tool empowers users to stop ongoing processes, providing a comprehensive solution for the management and control of both batch and Python processes on the Windows platform. The emphasis on a friendly interface aims to enhance user experience while ensuring effective process management.",
